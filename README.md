🪨✂️📄 Rock Paper Scissors Image Classifier

This project was created as a submission for the "Intro to Machine Learning" course on Dicoding.

The model was built using TensorFlow and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify hand gesture images into three categories: rock, paper, and scissors.

The code takes image input directly from a local directory, processes it, and predicts the corresponding class.
